            <p class="paragraph_title">
                The main reason for this is the 
                imperfection of the mechanism

                Four main types of human interaction 
                with the prosthesis can be distinguished:
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph_text">
                The first, most radical - various kinds of 
                implants in the motor and sensory zones 
                of the cerebral cortex. 
                Such an interface has the same disadvantages 
                as a transplanted arm. Implants in the 
                brain are especially appropriate when, 
                for whatever reason, the connection between 
                the brain and the arm is broken. In other cases, 
                it is worthwhile to additionally assess 
                the benefit / risk of using such an interface.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph_text">
                The second control method is the use of 
                electroencephalography (EEG). 
                The EEG method is based on recording the bioelectrical 
                activity of the brain that occurs as a result of 
                the spread of the action potential through neurons. 
                The method is considered promising, but has 
                a number of technical difficulties that prevent 
                the appearance of an interface based on it. 
                Firstly, because of the peculiarities of 
                registering a brain activity map, the system 
                needs to be “trained” again when moving the 
                electrodes. And secondly, the signal itself 
                is very unstable to various kinds of electrical 
                interference and interference.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph_text">
                Third: implantation of electrodes to peripheral 
                neurons in the remaining part of the arm. 
                This method has all the same problems as 
                transplantation and brain implants, and it 
                also requires long-term and individual work of doctors.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph_text">
                And the last type of interface is electromyography (EMG). 
                Its simplest implementation - trigger - is used in 
                mechanical prostheses, controlling the 
                compression or expansion of the hand. 
                In bionic prostheses, the exact same control 
                system is introduced. But, as already mentioned, 
                EMG in them is used only for two degrees of 
                freedom - flexion and extension of the fingers. 
                Also, a third degree of freedom can be added to 
                them - the simultaneous tension of both muscles, 
                on which EMG activity is measured.
