                <p class="paragraph_text">
                    Over the past decade, technology has taken 
                    tremendous steps toward the future. 
                    Electric vehicles that are environmentally friendly, 
                    high-speed trains that reach speeds of up 
                    to 580 km / h and, of course, prostheses that can 
                    restore the functionality of a lost limb. 
                    All this has long been not science fiction, 
                    but our reality. 
                    Technologies in the field of prosthetics have 
                    developed to such an extent that the modern 
                    bionic prosthesis can be considered a full limb 
                    of the cyborg, the man of the future.

                                The bionic prosthesis, which is also bioelectric and 
                                myoelectric, works by reading the special potential 
                                sensors that produce during the tension of the preserved 
                                muscle tissue of the arm with special myo-sensors. 
                                Myo sensors, which ensure the correct reading of 
                                this electrical potential, consist of sensitive electrodes. 
                                They transmit the read signal to the microprocessor, 
                                the brain of the entire prosthesis, which performs the 
                                processing of the received information using computer 
                                algorithms. As a result, the microprocessor, relying on 
                                the received signal, forms commands in a split second 
                                and sends them to the engines (motors), which set in

                        Let's look first at what “bionic prostheses” are. 
                        Bionics is an applied science that combines 
                        biology and technology. 
                        Wildlife helps scientists find solutions for 
                        technical devices. There are biological bionics, 
                        which studies processes in biological systems, 
                        theoretical, which builds mathematical models of 
                        these processes and technical. We now need 
                        technical bionics: it applies theoretical bionics 
                        models to solve engineering problems, as is the 
                        case with prostheses.

                                    use myography or an encephalogram.

                                    The British company RSLSteeper, which currently

                                    introduced the BeBionic bionic prosthesis to the 
                                    international market in 2010. At that time, an 
                                    artificial arm for an adult had only four functional 
                                    grips, but it already allowed you to eat, drink, 
                                    print, turn the key in the lock, use an ATM and 
                                    hold small objects. Using the device, the user 
                                    can break eggs and hold a disposable cup in his 
                                    hand - because even the force of pressing is 
                                    regulated by commands removed by sensors 
                                    from the muscles.
