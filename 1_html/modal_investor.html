                entertainment - everything in this world is changing 
                under the influence of innovative technologies. 
                Software developments are already used by most 
                large companies, and in the future it is planned

                Our investment team is looking for unique startups.

                This is a startup.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph_title">
                This box has a cost. 
                Its value increases as you put different things there. 
                Add a patent and the cost will increase. 
                Add a funky team of managers, and the cost will increase. 
                Just right?

                And this box is magic.

            <p class="paragraph_title">
                I also want to make myself such a box!
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph_title">
                The problem is that building such a box can be too 
                expensive. Therefore, you need to go and meet 
                people who have money (let's call them investors) 
                and offer them a deal that will look something 
                like this: "Give me a million dollars so 
                I can build a box and you will receive X 
                percent of everything, what will come of it."

            <p class="paragraph_title">
                But what should this X be equal to?

                4. The method of comparable operations <br>
                <br>
                In fact, the method of comparable operations is just a triple rule, 
                known from mathematics.

                An investor always seeks to find a certain level of return

                In addition, in accordance with the standards of 
                the investment industry, the investor suggests that 
                in eight years your box can be sold for $ 100 million.
