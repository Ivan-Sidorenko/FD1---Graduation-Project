                        However, AI differs from robotics, which is 
                        based on the use of hardware. The goal of 
                        AI is not automation of manual labor, but 
                        the reliable and continuous execution of numerous 
                        large-scale computerized tasks. 
                        Such automation requires human participation 
                        for the initial setup of the system and the 
                        proper formulation of questions.

                        A few years ago, creating a fraud detection 
                        system with five hidden levels was almost 
                        impossible. Everything has changed with 
                        the tremendous increase in computing power 
                        and the advent of "big data." 
                        For models of deep learning, a huge amount 
                        of data is necessary, since it is on their 
                        basis that they are trained. 
                        Therefore, the more data, the more accurate 
                        the model.

                        Typically, AI technology is not implemented 
                        as a standalone application. AI functionality 
                        is integrated into existing products, allowing 
                        them to be improved, just like Siri technology 
                        was added to Apple's next-generation devices. 
                        Automation, communication platforms, bots and 
                        smart computers combined with large volumes 
                        of data can improve various technologies that 
                        are used at home and in offices: from security 
                        data analysis systems to investment 
                        analysis tools.

                        training, and the more often we use these tools, 
                        the more effective they become.

                        AI technologies (deep training, image 
                        classification, object recognition) is 
                        not inferior in accuracy to the conclusions 
                        of highly qualified radiologists.

                        allow the algorithm to master a specific skill: 
                        the algorithm becomes a classifier or predictor. 
                        Thus, by the same principle by which an algorithm 
                        masters a game of chess, he can learn to offer 
                        suitable products online. At the same time, models 
                        adapt as new data arrives. Backpropagation is a method 
                        that provides model adjustment through training 
                        based on new data if the initial answer is incorrect.

                        intellectual property.

                        just need to find them using AI technology. 
                        Because data now plays a much more important 
                        role than ever before, it can provide a 
                        competitive advantage. When using the same
